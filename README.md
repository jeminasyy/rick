# RICK Ticketing System Project Overview

### Client: 
University of Santo Tomas College of Commerce and Business Administration
### Problem: 
When classes were shifted to remote learning, the college has been handling student concerns manually using email, social media, and Zoom. 
Instead, the faculty and staffs have to allocate their time to address these concerns. 
Students are only updated once their concern has been fully addressed, thus lacking in interaction.
### Solution: 
A web-based ticketing system that serves as a single point of contact, and enables the client to manage student requests, inquiries, and concerns in a centralized manner by applying ITIL 4 practices. <br /><br />
Service Desk serves as a single point of contact for the students to submit their requests, inquiries, and concerns. Students can submit or reopen tickets using the system. To promote engagement, students receive notifications through their email.
<br /><br />
Service Request Management is a set of processes applied to enable our client operate effectively in addressing student concerns, and improve the student's satisfaction during service request fulfillment. 
The following Service Request Management practices were implemented: <br />
1. **Ticket Management.** Tickets are automatically assigned by the system based on the category specified by the student. <br />
2. **Ticket Categorization.** Ticket are categorized into requests, inquiries, or concerns.  <br />
3. **System Notifications** Users are notified when a ticket has been assigned or transferred to them. <br />
4. **Status.** There are 7 ticket status: (1)New, (2)Opened, (3)Ongoing, (4)Resolved, (5)Inactive, (6)Voided, and (7)Reopened
5. **Ticket Prioritization.** To enable the assigned Front Desk Officer manage tickets based on urgency, the priority level of a ticket can be set as (1)High, (2)Medium, and (3)Low.
6. **Transfer Tickets.** The assigned Front Desk Officer can transfer miscategorized tickets to another category and/or Front Desk Officer.
